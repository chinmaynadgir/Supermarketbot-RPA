# Supermarketbot-RPA
An RPA Based solution to inventory management of supermarkets and also a Python based GUI to make and read bills.Manually recording store stock is a time-consuming and labor-intensive operation that  involves clicking, copying, and pasting. By deploying robots to do the same, an organisation  might save thousands of hours of work each month. Thus we would be developing a bot  application which would manage Laborious tasks such as reordering, intelligently based on  the requirements , the selling speed and various other factors to make the more efficient  business choices . This technology might also be used to automate communications with  suppliers
