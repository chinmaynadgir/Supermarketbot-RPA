# Supermarketbot-RPA
An RPA Based solution to inventory management of supermarkets and also a Python based GUI to make and read bills<hr width ="80%">
With the help of UiPath to implement an RPA solution, we were able to automate the process of alerting the vendor via email when an itemâ€™s stock falls beyond a particular limit, thereby improving efficiency as manually keeping track is time consuming. <br>Supermarkets are an excellent example of businesses that have benefited from automation. Manually recording store stock was cumbersome, time-consuming, and repetitive. Robotic deployment makes this task faster, less error-prone, and saves the company hundreds of hours of manual labor. The bot is designed to reduce number of items from the totals of their respective inventory after being purchased and is required to send an email to the concerned manufactures placing orders for the same.
